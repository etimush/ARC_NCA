Repo for solving arc problems with a Neural Cellular Automata 
# Files you can run

Training_Ignore_Size_change:  Run this to train different CAs, ignoring ARC-AGI problems with differing input and output sizes. <br>
Train_Padd_to_size: Run this to train different CAs, maximally padding the ARC-AGI problems with padding tokens. <br>
Visualise: Make .mp4 videos of selected problems for selected CA. <br>
Visualise_PAdded: Make .mp4 videos of selected problems for selected CA. <br>
Data_parsing: generates statistics and comparisons. <br>
